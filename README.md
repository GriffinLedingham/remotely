- rsync

## Install
```
npm install -g https://github.com/charlesbodman/remotely
```

## Usage

**Create remotely config**
```

```

**Watch local directory for changes and rsync push on change**
```
remotely watch
```

**Rsync pull down remote**
```
remotely pull
```

**Rsync push to remote**

```

## Config
Remotely will look for the config file `.remotely.json` in any directory above where you call `remotely [command]`.
This means that the config can belong anywhere, as long as remotely can find it by traversing upwards

| Config        | Desc         |                |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| local         | local path to sync dir | required |
| remote      | remote host and path | required |
| rsync_flags | flags to customize rsync  | optional |

**Example config**

This could live in `/Users/charliebodman/documents/kano/apps/.remotely.json` 
You can create remotely config by calling `remotely init`
```javascript
{
    "local":"/Users/charliebodman/documents/kano/apps", 
    "remote":"charlie@example.com:~/kano/apps"
    "rsync_flags":"-Wavzh --stats --delete"
}
```
